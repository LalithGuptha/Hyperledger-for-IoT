# Securing Smart Home IoT devices using Hyperledger Fabric

The project aims to implement Hyperledger fabric blockchain network using Fablo toolkit for securing smart home IoT devices.
This network is simulated using Docker Containers. Hyperledger Explorer and Hyperledger Caliper is also integrated with the project.

## Abstract
The project ex-
plores the application of Hyperledger Fabric, a private permissioned
blockchain framework, with Fablo toolkit as a robust solution to en-
hance the security of Smart Home IoT devices. Hyperledger Fabric’s
decentralized and tamper-resistant nature provides a foundation for
establishing a secure and transparent environment for IoT devices.
By leveraging the inherent features of Hyperledger Fabric, such as
it’s consensus mechanism, smart contracts, and permissioned network
structure, this research aims to mitigate common security concerns
associated with Smart Home IoT devices, including unauthorized ac-
cess, data tampering, and device compromise

The future scope of this project is to deploy the fabric network in Raspbery Pi modules (peers) once the ARM images of the fabric is available. Integrating other features like Hyperledger Firefly, etc is also planned.
